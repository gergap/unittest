Building instructions
=====================

The code is built using CMake. This is done typically in an out-of-source
build using the following steps:

    # create a build directory
    mkdir bld
    cd bld
    # create a Makefile
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/locl -DBUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    # build
    make
    # execute tests
    make test
    # optionally build API documentation (requires doxygen)
    make doc
    # install
    sudo make install
